# IBM UrbanCode Email Plugin
---

This plugin enables a process step to email a team.  The email subject, body, and attachment may be entered and configured.
The plugin works with both UC Build and UC Deploy.  However, the querying of the teams and email must be done in UC Deploy.
This is because the REST service in UC Build are not built out to obtain the team and email addresses based on the process.
